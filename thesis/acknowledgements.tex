\begin{acknowledgements}
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, \drcap Robbert Krebbers.
Firstly, for suggesting the research topic which turned out to be an interesting avenue to learn more about the subtleties of the C programming language, its formalizations, and compiler optimizations.
Secondly, for the weekly meetings and discussions about the restrict semantics.
These have been crucial for achieving the results presented in this thesis.
Thank you also to \drcap Freek Wiedijk for agreeing to be the second reader and giving some insight into
the ISO standard and WG14.

I would also like to thank \drcap Chris Hathhorn for sharing a more elaborate paper on the \cink{} semantics
for undefined behavior.
I am also grateful to \drcap Richard Biener, for answering several restrict-related GCC questions.

Then, I would like to thank my student colleagues in the so-called thesis factory.
In particular Orpheas van Rooij, for proofreading a large portion of the thesis and providing me with useful feedback.
But also all the others with whom I have shared countless coffee breaks, lunch walks, and performances as a vocal ensemble.

Lastly, I would also like to thank my family and friends for their support throughout the last eight months.
